                        "HR has played a leading role in helping transform Tyco from a
                        holding to operating company model, then merge with Johnson
                        Controls. As CHRO, I needed to build a senior HR team who could
                        link business strategy to HR strategy, provide strategic guidance
                        to senior leaders, build the total rewards and talent infrastructure, and
                        stand up more efficient delivery processes. Rebecca has proven to be a
                        key player on my Direct Report team enabling the transformation first in
                        corporate, then as a multi-business unit HR lead, and on critical enterprise
                        projects. She has a strong reputation across the Management Team and has
                        presented to our Board. She is particularly gifted with setting up
                        effective talent practices and building line of site through metrics
                        to enable bold talent moves."

                        "I recruited Rebecca to be my HR
                        Business Partner as we embarked on a journey
                        to transform the finance function in support
                        of the enterprise strategy to move from a
                        holding to a global operating company model.
                        Our objective was to improve the quality of
                        the finance function while reducing cost by 30%.
                        Rebecca's strong business acumen and talent
                        management expertise were critical in pulling
                        together an effective organization design, selecting the
                        right leaders in critical roles to drive performance,
                        creating an effective governance model, and establishing
                        an operating rhythm that gave constant line of sight
                        through key metrics. The real measure of success is that
                        much of the work that we did is still in place after
                        three years even as leadership has changed."

                            "It does not take long to realize Rebecca is an asset to any
                            business. Her probing intellectual curiosity, capacity to see
                            multiple factors and broad reaching implications, and ability
                            to translate and link the business strategy to the talent strategy
                            is quickly evident. The Fire Products business is known for developing
                            and exporting leaders across the company. Rebecca was able to take
                            the talent system to the next level by seeing connections across a
                            complex global matrix and other businesses broadening the talent pool.
                            She advanced our performance management capability, helped build our
                            culture during tough economic times, and was a trusted advisor and
                            coach to the talent at all levels. Rebecca is not only one of the
                            top HR Leaders I’ve worked with but also one of the best business
                            leaders."

                            her manager, and then colleague on the HR
                            Leadership team of a $10B company. She is a
                            strategic thinker who can tie business strategy
                            to talent practices, then implement sustainable
                            plans, with metrics to define success. Rebecca
                            builds strong relationships from the C-Suite to the
                            manufacturing floor, and has a demonstrated ability
                            to influence within the HR organization and her
                            business team. She contributes to both the business
                            strategy and the human capital strategy, and supports
                            her business in deferentially investing in talent,
                            which has led to a number of creative cross-enterprise
                            talent moves. Her understanding of the potential impact
                            of strong HR processes, and her tireless work ethic,
                            will add value to any business team."

                            Rebecca is one of them. She has business "street smarts" matched with
                            a high-level of integrity. I would not hesitate to bring her into
